Phone App project CIS 132 Swift 3

3/17 This is a vaction destination app project I'm doing for my Swift 3 class at MWCC.

5/17 I finished the project for the class and then went on to improve it. The assignment was for just a basic app that used an array to hold the data and provided only limited functionaltity. The improved version that I just completed uses core data for persistance, has a camera/photo library function, uses reverse geocoding to implement a map function, has more advanced search features, and numerous other functions that make this a full featured application.
